### Monorepo Tree Contribution

This contribution adds a customized explorer that provides a better experience for navigating inside Google3.
Many files inside this folder have been duplicated and customized from `workbench/contrib/files`.

There are three main features added by this contribution:

1. Scope Folder Feature
    This feature provided a scope functionality that allows the user to show a specific folder as root on the explorer.

2. Global and Workspace Bookmarks
    This feature allows the user to add folder and files into workspace and global bookmarks.

3. Recent Directories
    This feature shows the recently bookmarked directories or directories of recently opened files.

This contribution is maintained outside VSCode source code, otherwise it would have to be applied as a patch.
